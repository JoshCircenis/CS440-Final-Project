# CS440-Final-Project
Final project for CS440 - NLBSE Tool Competition Code Comment Classification

The model which I proposed in my paper are in the folder "Proposed In Paper". There are three jupyter notebooks one for each language to make them simple and straightforward. These models use tensorflow 2.18.0 and keras 3.7.0 as well as tf_keras, huggingface-hub, and transformers library.

This repository also has a model that I started working on but haven't fully finished or reached optimal performance with yet. This model is in the "In Progress" folder. This model attempts to use a single transformer base model with three classification heads to create a model that can fulfill the NLBSE competition requirements with a single model which would decrease memory footprint and computation requirements.
